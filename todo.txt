1. Make a welcome landing page with a dropdown form for selecting schools (use forms.Select widget)
2. Make the welcome page actually take you to a new page for a specific school
3. Ensure that feature works for 2 different schools (dropdown has 2 or more choices, also include schools in admin so more can be added through admin panel)
4. Finish a single schools .html file, get it looking nice using CSS if need be and include some data on there
5. Attempt to extend the template for the finished .html onto every schools html template page
