1. Ensure that feature works for 2 different schools (dropdown has 2 or more choices, also include schools in admin so more can be added through admin panel) //just need to add putnam template
2. Finish a single schools .html file, get it looking nice using CSS if need be and include some data on there //sorta done, could be better
3. Attempt to extend the template for the finished .html onto every schools html template page //as of now you can copy code and just change header. should try "extends" keyword
4. Add more data
5.Clean up login functionality code(try decorators) and extend functionality to all school templates
6.Setup "regular" users with less perms
7.Setup a secondary branch in github for test development of features(and so if I destroy everything I can go back to safety)
